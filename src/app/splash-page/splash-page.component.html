    <div class="about-container">
      <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>ngVault Demo</strong> — a living showcase of how
        <strong>secure, reactive state</strong> transforms Angular applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        ngVault combines the power of <strong>signals</strong> with a modular
        <strong>vault-based architecture</strong> to make state management both <em>simple</em> and
        <em>predictable</em>. It’s designed to be <strong>framework-native</strong>,
        <strong>developer-friendly</strong>, and <strong>production-safe</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each vault encapsulates its own state, logic, and lifecycle — giving you isolated, traceable state containers
        that automatically synchronize and react in real time. No boilerplate, no guessing, no hidden mutations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the <strong>Examples</strong> below to see how ngVault effortlessly manages reactive data flows. Watch how a
        user list updates instantly as new entities are loaded, and how derived state stays perfectly in sync.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, open the <strong><span (click)="openMenu()" class="pointer success">Dev Tools</span></strong> panel to
        dive deeper. You’ll see every <em>event</em>, <em>patch</em>, and <em>state change</em>
        logged in sequence — a transparent view into the vault’s reactive core.
      </p>

      <p>
        ngVault is more than just state management — it’s a full lifecycle engine built for clarity, composability, and
        security at scale.
